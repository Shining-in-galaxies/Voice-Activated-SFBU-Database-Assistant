# Voice-Activated SFBU Database Assistant

## Overview

This project combines voice recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create a voice-activated assistant similar to Siri or Alexa. It utilizes the SFBU database for retrieving information based on user queries. The assistant listens to the user's voice, processes the spoken words into text, retrieves relevant information from the SFBU database, and responds verbally with the information.

## Features

- Voice recognition via Whisper model.
- Information retrieval from the SFBU database using LangChain.
- Verbal responses using Google's Text-to-Speech API.
- Easy-to-use, voice-activated interface.
